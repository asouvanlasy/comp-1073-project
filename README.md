# COMP-1073 React Chart.js Project
Project by Andrew Souvanlasy, Hunter Roseborough, Thomas Caulfeild.\
The reason we choose sales because it was one of the first ideas that came to mind and and is a very simple attribute to look at in a chart.
We chose North American video games sales becuase we enjoy playing games in our free time and where interested in some of there sales.
We choose the top selling video games for the line graph because we are interested in the top selling games.
We choose electric car prices for the radar graph becuase they are a big part of reducing global emessions and knowing there pricing is good to know.
